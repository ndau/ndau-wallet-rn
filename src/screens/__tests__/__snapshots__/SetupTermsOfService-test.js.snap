            All POTENTIAL ndau holders should acknowledge that while the Target Price may rise AS ADOPTION MOVES along the S-curve there is no guarantee that this will happen. There is no guarantee that a holder of ndau WILL get any particular minimum price upon selling. The Floor Price is not an absolute guaranteed price. There may be temporary or permanent liquidity constraints. Further, as the Floor Price is dependent on the dynamic value of the Endowment, it will rise and fall accordingly to that value and other factors. All POTENTIAL ndau holders should understand that features such as the STABILIZATION INCENTIVE BURN (“SIB”) cannot apply to off-blockchain transactions. Further, THE ECOSYSTEM ALIGNMENT INCENTIVE (“EAI”) should not be confused with an “interest rate” in the legacy financial system. The EAI is awarded for behavior that aligns with the purpose of ndau as a long-term store of value. Should all ndau holders lock up their ndau for 3 years and be awarded 15 percent more ndau per year as a result, this does not increase the value of the Endowment proportionally. In fact, it will lower the Floor Price unless the Endowment were, coincidentally, to grow by that same amount through its own return on investments. Further, the EAI is not offered passively but rather is awarded in association with contracting with or directly operating ndau nodes and thus increases the value of the whole ecosystem through participatory efforts. No contractual guarantees are given directly to ndau holders since all policy and features described herein are subject to governance by the BLOCKCHAIN POLICY COUNCIL. THIS DASHBOARD DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A PROSPECTUS OR OFFERING DOCUMENT AND DOES NOT AND IS NOT INTENDED TO CONSTITUTE AN OFFER TO SELL, NOR THE SOLICITATION OF ANY OFFER TO BUY, AN INVESTMENT, A SECURITY OR A COMMODITY, OR AN OPTION ON OR ANY OTHER RIGHT TO ACQUIRE ANY SUCH INVESTMENT, SECURITY OR COMMODITY. THIS DASHBOARD HAS NOT BEEN REVIEWED BY, PASSED ON OR SUBMITTED TO ANY U.S. FEDERAL OR STATE AGENCY OR SELF REGULATORY ORGANIZATION OR TO ANY OTHER FOREIGN AGENCY OR SELF-REGULATORY ORGANIZATION. THIS DASHBOARD DOES NOT CONSTITUTE ADVICE TO PURCHASE ANY NDAU NOR SHOULD IT BE RELIED UPON IN CONNECTION WITH ANY CONTRACT OR CONTRIBUTION DECISION. THE NDAU TOKENS HAVE NOT BEEN AND WILL NOT BE REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE “SECURITIES ACT”), OR ANY OTHER LAW OR REGULATION GOVERNING THE OFFERING, SALE OR EXCHANGE OF SECURITIES IN THE UNITED STATES OR ANY OTHER JURISDICTION. THE OFFERING OF NDAU TOKENS IS MADE (1) INSIDE THE UNITED STATES TO “ACCREDITED INVESTORS” (AS DEFINED IN SECTION 501 OF THE SECURITIES ACT) IN RELIANCE ON REGULATION D UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT TO U.S. PERSONS (AS DEFINED IN SECTION 902 OF REGULATION S UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT) AND (2) OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES TO NON-U.S. PERSONS IN RELIANCE ON REGULATION S. SUBJECT TO CERTAIN LIMITED EXCEPTIONS, PERSONS PURCHASING AS U.S. ACCREDITED INVESTORS WILL BE REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN THEIR NDAU TOKENS UNTIL THE FIRST ANNIVERSARY OF THE ISSUANCE OF THE NDAU TOKENS. PERSONS PURCHASING AS NON-U.S. PERSONS WILL ONLY BE ENTITLED TO RESELL THEIR NDAU TOKENS AFTER 90 DAYS FROM THE ISSUANCE DATE TO OTHER NON-U.S. PERSONS IN AN OFFSHORE TRANSACTION (AS DEFINED IN RULE 902 OF THE SECURITIES ACT). THIS DASHBOARD CONTAINS FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS THAT ARE BASED ON THE BELIEFS OF THE AXIOM FOUNDATION, AS WELL AS CERTAIN ASSUMPTIONS MADE BY AND INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO THE AXIOM FOUNDATION. THE PROJECT AS ENVISAGED IN THE WHITEPAPER ASSOCIATED WITH THIS DASHBOARD IS UNDER DEVELOPMENT AND IS BEING CONSTANTLY UPDATED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO KEY GOVERNANCE AND TECHNICAL FEATURES. ACCORDINGLY, IF AND WHEN THE PROJECT IS COMPLETED, IT MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE PROJECT SET OUT IN THAT WHITEPAPER. NO REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY IS GIVEN AS TO THE ACHIEVEMENT OR REASONABLENESS OF ANY PLANS, FUTURE PROJECTIONS OR PROSPECTS AND NOTHING IN THAT WHITEPAPER IS OR SHOULD BE RELIED UPON AS A PROMISE OR REPRESENTATION AS TO THE FUTURE. OWNERSHIP OF NDAU WILL CARRY NO RIGHTS, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, OTHER THAN A LIMITED POTENTIAL FUTURE RIGHT OR EXPECTATION TO USE NDAU AS SET FORTH IN THIS WHITEPAPER AND IN THE DISTRIBUTION TERMS AND CONDITIONS. NDAU ARE NOT INTENDED FOR INVESTMENT, SPECULATIVE OR OTHER FINANCIAL PURPOSES. NDAU DO NOT REPRESENT OR CONSTITUTE: • ANY OWNERSHIP RIGHT OR STAKE, SHARE, EQUITY, SECURITY, COMMODITY, BOND, DEBT INSTRUMENT OR ANY OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT OR INVESTMENT CARRYING EQUIVALENT RIGHTS; • ANY RIGHT TO RECEIVE FUTURE REVENUES, PROFITS, DIVIDENDS, INTEREST, SHARES, EQUITIES, SECURITIES OR ANY OTHER FORM OF PARTICIPATION, ECONOMIC OR OTHERWISE, OR ANY GOVERNANCE RIGHT IN OR RELATING TO NDAU, OR THE AXIOM FOUNDATION; • ANY FORM OF MONEY OR LEGAL TENDER IN ANY JURISDICTION NOR DO THEY CONSTITUTE ANY REPRESENTATION OF MONEY (INCLUDING ELECTRONIC MONEY); • THE PROVISION OF ANY GOODS OR SERVICES PRIOR TO THE DATE ON WHICH NDAU MAY BE DELIVERED TO CONTRIBUTORS; OR • ANY FUTURE RIGHT TO SELL NDAU, OR TRADE NDAU TO OR WITH ANY OTHER PARTY. NDAU WILL BE DISTRIBUTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS SET FORTH IN THE DISTRIBUTION TERMS AND CONDITIONS, AS PUBLISHED ON NDAU’S WEBSITE FROM TIME TO TIME. THE AXIOM FOUNDATION MAY DECIDE IN ITS SOLE DISCRETION, TO ABANDON THE NDAU ECOSYSTEM AND TO FOREGO ISSUING ANY ADDITIONAL NDAU. THE AXIOM FOUNDATION INTENDS TO OPERATE IN FULL COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS AND REGULATIONS AND OBTAIN THE NECESSARY LICENCES AND APPROVALS AS MAY BE REQUIRED IN ITS OPINION IN KEY MARKETS. THIS MEANS THAT THE DEVELOPMENT AND ROLL-OUT OF ALL THE FEATURES OF NDAU AS DESCRIBED IN THIS WHITEPAPER ARE NOT GUARANTEED. REGULATORY LICENCES OR APPROVALS MAY BE REQUIRED IN A NUMBER OF RELEVANT JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH RELEVANT ACTIVITIES MAY TAKE PLACE. IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO GUARANTEE, AND NO PERSON MAKES ANY ASSURANCES, THAT ANY SUCH LICENCES OR APPROVALS WILL BE OBTAINED WITHIN A PARTICULAR TIMEFRAME OR AT ALL. THIS MEANS THAT NDAU MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE IN CERTAIN MARKETS, OR AT ALL. THIS COULD REQUIRE THE RESTRUCTURING OF THE NDAU ECOSYSTEM OR RESULT ITS UNAVAILABILITY IN ALL OR CERTAIN RESPECTS. THE AXIOM FOUNDATION RESERVES THE RIGHT TO REVISE THE ASSOCIATED WHITEPAPER FROM TIME TO TIME IN ITS SOLE DISCRETION. ANY REVISIONS TO THAT WHITEPAPER WILL BE MADE AVAILABLE ON NDAU’S WEBSITE OR DIRECTLY TO KNOWN HOLDERS THROUGH THEIR PROVIDED COMMUNICATION MEANS, IF AVAILABLE. BEFORE A POTENTIAL NDAU HOLDER ACQUIRES NDAU TOKENS, THE AXIOM FOUNDATION MAY (IN ITS SOLE AND ABSOLUTE DISCRETION) REQUEST THAT SUCH POTENTIAL NDAU HOLDERS PROVIDE CERTAIN INFORMATION AND DOCUMENTATION FOR THE PURPOSES OF COMPLYING WITH ANY “KNOW YOUR CUSTOMER” ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING OR SIMILAR OBLIGATIONS TO WHICH THE AXIOM FOUNDATION MAY BE SUBJECT; AND DETERMINE THAT IT IS NECESSARY TO OBTAIN CERTAIN OTHER INFORMATION ABOUT SUCH POTENTIAL NDAU HOLDER IN ORDER TO COMPLY WITH APPLICABLE LAWS AND REGULATIONS IN CONNECTION WITH THE SALE OF NDAU TOKENS. POTENTIAL NDAU HOLDERS SHALL BE SUBJECT TO SUCH OTHER DUE DILIGENCE AS THE AXIOM FOUNDATION DEEMS NECESSARY OR APPROPRIATE IN ITS SOLE AND ABSOLUTE DISCRETION. FURTHER, THE AXIOM FOUNDATION RESERVES THE RIGHT IN ITS SOLE AND ABSOLUTE DISCRETION TO REFUSE TO SELL NDAU TOKENS TO ANY POTENTIAL HOLDER.
