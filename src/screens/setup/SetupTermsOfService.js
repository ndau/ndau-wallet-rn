            that (i) the cryptocurrency market is inherently volatile and is
            characterized as high risk, and thus subject to inherent

            regarding the Tokens, or the cryptocurrency acquired by you used to
            purchase our Tokens), and that (ii) you are able to bear the
            economic risk associated with subscribing for the Tokens or other

            TRADE OF ANY CRYPTOCURRENCY. 3.4. SPECIFICALLY, WE MAKE NO
            COMMITMENT AS TO THE VALUE OF THE TOKENS, THEIR ECONOMIC VALUE, NOR
            THE TRADABILITY OF ANY TOKENS. WE ASSUME NO RESPONSIBILITY REGARDING

            12.1. Subject to any applicable law, all disputes between you and us
            shall only be resolved on an individual basis and you shall not have
            the right to bring any claim against us as a plaintiff or a member
            of a class, consolidated or representative actions (or any other
            legal proceedings conducted by a group or by representatives on
            behalf of others). 12.2. These Terms are governed by the General
            Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. You hereby consent to the
            exclusive jurisdiction and venue of courts in Wilmington, New Castle
            County, Delaware 19801, U.S.A. in all disputes arising out of or
            relating to the use of the Platform. Use of the Platform is
            unauthorized in any jurisdiction that does not give effect to all
            provisions of these terms and conditions, including without
            limitation this paragraph. You agree that no joint venture,
            partnership, employment, or agency relationship exists between you
            and Oneiro as a result of these Terms and/or any use of the Platform

            unenforceable pursuant to applicable law including, but not limited
            to, the warranty disclaimers and liability limitations set forth
            above, then the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed
            superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that most closely
            matches the intent of the original provision and the remainder of
            the agreement shall continue in effect. 12.5. Unless otherwise
            specified herein, these Terms constitute the entire agreement
            between you and Oneiro with respect to the Platform and it
